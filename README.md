### <span style="color:Beige"> Monster Collection </span>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>In Monstermon, players can build their own monster collection by creating unique monsters with names, types, and health points. These monsters can be assigned to specific teams, ready to be called upon for thrilling battles against other teams. The ability to customize and strategically assemble teams adds an extra layer of excitement to the monster battling experience.</p>
</div>

### <span style="color:Beige"> Monster Battling </span>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>In Monstermon, monsters come in three different types: fire, water, and grass. Each monster has a base damage of 50, which is then multiplied by a type-specific multiplier during battle. If a monster has a type advantage over its opponent, its damage multiplier is increased to 1.5, while a type disadvantage results in a multiplier of 0.5. This creates an exciting and strategic element to the battles, as players must consider the types of their monsters and their opponents' to maximize their damage. </p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left">
<p> Type advantages and disadvantages in Monstermon are calculated using the following system: </p>

</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Monstermon battles are intense one-on-one matchups between monsters. Each battle continues until one monster's health points are depleted, at which point the next monster from the respective team enters the arena. This process continues until all the monsters on one team have been defeated, resulting in a victorious team. The tension and excitement build as players strategize and select their monsters, knowing that one false move could lead to defeat. </p>

## <span style="color:AliceBlue"> **Why is this project of interest to you?**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>As a dedicated fan of the Pokémon franchise, the development of this monster collection and battling simulation game holds a special significance to me. My passion for this genre of games has only grown stronger as I delve into the intricate functionalities and concepts behind them. The captivating stories and adventure-style gameplay of the Pokémon franchise have always captivated me and helped me sharpen my problem-solving skills and strategic thinking.</p>
<p>With this project, I aim to take my understanding of both Pokémon and Java programming to a new level by creating a smaller scale simulation that captures the essence of the Pokémon experience. I am excited to explore the possibilities of this project and push my skills to their limits.</p>

## <span style="color:AliceBlue"> **Future Refactoring**
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>After reviewing the UML diagram, I believe that implementing the Observer Pattern would benefit my application. To achieve this, I would create an "Observer" interface and a "Subject" class. Both the ManipulateMonstersTab and the ViewTeamsTab would extend the Observer interface, and the MonstermonUI would extend the Subject class. This implementation would ensure that any changes made to the Monstermon field within MonstermonUI would trigger the update method, updating the corresponding Tabs to display the Monsters that are part of the Teams accurately.</p>
<p>Moreover, I plan to refactor the code in the future to eliminate unnecessary clutter by removing the Monsters and Teams classes, and implementing the saving and loading functionality within the Monster and Team classes. I would also like to make the Team class implement the Iterable interface over Monster. This modification would create blissful ignorance as discussed in class, enabling the for each loop to perform its function without knowing much about the monsters field or the operation being carried out on them. Additionally, removing monsters from teams would be a simpler process with the implementation of iterators, which would allow for easy removal.</p>
